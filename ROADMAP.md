## Current state — 2026-04-22

**Branch:** `feat/metric-rationalization` (PR #22). 14 commits ahead of main.
CI locally green.

**Completed in this work cycle:**
- ✅ Structural cascade metric + MAX_CASCADE_DEPTH 10 → 200 (commit `2340eac`)
- ✅ Topology rename `warehouse-sd-w*` → `warehouse-single-dock-w*`
  (`97b65f3`) + SD-w2 `number_agents` demo default capped at 72 to stay
  inside TP's A* envelope
- ✅ Queue kick-back stranding fix: `goal = agent.pos` instead of
  `pickup_cell` (`2ee0313`) — resolves user-reported "agents stuck at
  delivery in picking state"; Loading-streak ceiling ≤ 5 ticks verified
- ✅ Token Passing goal-change sync + rewind determinism (`845a6fb`)
- ✅ Aisle-width sweep: 3 single-dock variants (w1 / w2 / w3) × 3
  solvers × 6 scenarios × 30 seeds. Post-kick-back-fix re-run on 3960
  priority cells done (34h30m wall). Full results frozen in the memory
  file `project_paams_aisle_width_results.md` and in
  `docs/papers/paper1_drafts/paams2026/section6_draft.md` (local only).

**Three publishable findings (post-fix, numbers frozen):**

1. **Structural cascade ∝ walkable area** at matched density —
   R² = 0.999 / 1.000 / 0.999 at tiers L / M / H.
2. **Mitigation Δ diverges with aisle width**, paradigm-ordered:
   RHCR-PBS −0.89 > PIBT −0.81 > Token Passing −0.41 per aisle step.
   TP artefact caveat: its ADG cascade ≈ 1.01 by construction.
3. **Aggregate FT is invariant to aisle width** at matched density
   (PIBT 0.592 / 0.602 / 0.598 across w1 / w2 / w3) — motivates the
   decomposition. 6/150 cells Braess-flagged, all RHCR-PBS at high
   density.

Pre-fix → post-fix drift: mean |Δ FT%| = 3.36%, comparative findings
preserved (§6.7 disclosure ready).

**Immediate remaining work — paper (highest priority):**
- Integrate the filled §6 draft from
  `docs/papers/paper1_drafts/paams2026/section6_draft.md` into
  `main.tex`. Regenerate the 5 figure references to the post-fix
  PNGs under `results/aisle_width/analysis/`.
- Refresh Table references to use the mitigation Δ + FT numbers in
  the updated draft.
- Write §6.7 correction-disclosure paragraph from
  `results/aisle_width/post_kickback_fix/delta_diff.csv`.
- Re-compile main.tex, confirm within 12-page LNCS budget, submit
  to AREA workshop by 2026-05-08.

**Deferred (tracked as post-submission work):**
- Task #67 — solver fidelity tests vs canonical pibt2 / RHCR C++
  references (gated behind a `fidelity` feature flag). Acceptance:
  throughput ±3%, action-sequence Hamming ≤ 5% on first 50 ticks.
- Out-of-envelope TP replanning — PIBT-fallback path inside
  Token Passing so TP at n > 100 stops deadlocking. Would let us
  report TP at SD-w2 n=108 and SD-w3 n=151 as legitimate cells
  rather than "out of envelope — skip".

## Solver: RHCR Improvements

### PBS — Focal Search (FOCAL_W heuristic)
**Status:** Not implemented. PBS currently uses pure-cost tie-breaking.  
**Impact:** Medium — PBS throughput is below reference on dense/warehouse maps. The reference C++ implementation uses a focal list (FOCAL_W = 1.0 by default) that finds conflict-minimal solutions faster.  
**What's needed:** Maintain a focal set of nodes within `[g_min, g_min * FOCAL_W]` from the open list; expand by conflict count (fewest conflicts first). Requires a separate heap sorted by `h_conflicts`, drained in parallel with the open list.  
**Reference:** `src/solver/pbs_planner.rs` — `PbsPlanner::plan_window()`; reference impl at `RHCR/src/PBS.cpp` (`focal_list`).

### Travel Penalties Wired Into Windowed Planners
**Status:** `WindowContext.travel_penalties` is populated but not yet consumed by any `WindowedPlanner`.  
**Impact:** Low — congestion-aware path selection is already tracked via `wait_counts` in `rhcr.rs`; the penalty layer is designed but inactive.  
**What's needed:** In `priority_astar_planner.rs` and `pbs_planner.rs`, add `travel_penalties[y*w+x]` as an additive g-cost bias in `spacetime_astar_fast`/`spacetime_astar_sequential`.  
**Reference:** `src/solver/windowed.rs:37` (`travel_penalties` field), `src/solver/priority_astar_planner.rs`.

### Distance Map Caching for Goal-Sequence Goals
**Status:** `fill_goal_sequences()` appends extra goals beyond the current immediate goal. The RHCR solver computes a `DistanceMap` for each agent's immediate goal but not for the extra sequence goals.  
**Impact:** Low — windowed planners currently use only the first distance map for sequence goals; heuristic quality degrades for agents pursuing a chained goal.  
**What's needed:** Cache `DistanceMap` per goal cell across replanning windows (evict when the goal is no longer in any agent's sequence). Pass aligned distance maps for each sequence goal into `WindowContext`.  
**Reference:** `src/solver/rhcr.rs` — `rebuild_distance_maps()` and `fill_goal_sequences()`.

## Analysis

### Formal MTBF / MTTR Confidence Intervals
**Status:** MTBF and MTTR are point estimates.  
**Impact:** Low for internal use, higher if published — reviewers will ask for CIs on these metrics.  
**What's needed:** Bootstrap CI (already done for throughput via `src/analysis/metrics.rs`) applied to MTBF/MTTR time series.

### Rename `deficit_integral` / `surplus_integral` → `lost_tasks_area` / `surplus_tasks_area`
**Status:** Paper-only rename in `docs/papers/paper1_drafts/paams2026/scope_decisions.md §4.2`. Code field names and CSV column headers are unchanged.
**Impact:** Low — purely a clarity improvement. The new names align with the resilience-triangle (Bruneau 2003) area framing used in the paper, which is friendlier to reliability-engineering reviewers than "integral."
**What's needed:**
- Rename `RunMetrics.deficit_integral` and `RunMetrics.surplus_integral` in `src/experiment/metrics.rs`
- Update CSV/JSON column headers in `src/experiment/export.rs`
- Update `BaselineDiff.deficit_integral` in `src/analysis/baseline.rs`
- Add a one-shot migration note in `results/paams_2026/README.md` so existing CSVs remain readable
**Why deferred:** Touching CSV headers invalidates downstream analysis scripts (`analyze_paams.py`) and forces re-running the dashboard. Doing this *after* PAAMS submission avoids any risk of breaking the figure pipeline during the final write-up.

### Verify or replace the Critical Time threshold citation
**Status:** `CRITICAL_TIME_THRESHOLD = 0.5` in `src/constants.rs` is currently framed as an operational SLA heuristic. The earlier "Ghasemieh & Haverkort 2015" attribution was incorrect and has been removed.
**Impact:** Medium for the paper — reviewers may ask for a formal grounding of the 50% threshold.
**What's needed:** Either find a verifiable academic source (a service-level objective paper, a degraded-mode operations paper, or a specific performability text), OR commit to the operational framing and cite an industry source (e.g., Amazon Robotics published reliability standards) if such a public reference exists.

## Heterogeneous Robot Fleets

### Speed Tiers and Size Constraints
**Status:** All agents are identical — same speed, size, and walkability.  
**Impact:** High — real warehouses mix fast pickers with slow heavy lifters. Size constraints determine which corridors a robot can enter.  
**What's needed:**
- `RobotType` component: speed multiplier, footprint radius, task affinity set, Weibull β/η overrides
- Per-type `GridMap` views: wide robots mark narrow corridors as unwalkable
- Spacetime A* cost parameterized by speed (different timestep costs per agent type)
- Type-aware task assignment: only assign robot type X to zone Y

### Differentiated Wear and Battery Model
**Status:** All agents share the same Weibull wear distribution. No battery model exists.  
**Impact:** Medium — heavy-load robots degrade faster; battery depletion is a distinct fault mode from mechanical wear.  
**What's needed:** Per-type β/η in `FaultConfig`. New fault scenario `BatteryDepletion`: agent stops when charge reaches 0, resumes after recharge delay. Recharge stations as a new zone type.

## Machine Learning / Deep Reinforcement Learning

### DRL Solver (PRIMAL-style — 5th Paradigm: Learned)
**Status:** Not implemented. Current 3 solvers (PIBT, RHCR-PBS, Token Passing) use classical algorithms.  
**Impact:** High research value — the key question for MAFIS is not "does DRL solve MAPF well?" but "does a learned policy degrade differently under faults than classical solvers?" DRL trained on fault-free maps may collapse faster under Weibull wear than PIBT, or generalize better due to implicit variation during training.  
**What's needed:** Decentralized DRL solver where each agent acts from a local observation (k×k grid patch + goal direction + nearby agent states). Implements `LifelongSolver` trait — one `step()` call per tick, no window. Candidate architectures: PRIMAL (Sartoretti et al., 2019), MAGAT (Li et al., 2021). Would be the 4th solver alongside the current 3 classical solvers (PIBT, RHCR-PBS, Token Passing).  
**Research angle:** Run the full fault scenario matrix (5 scenarios × all topologies) with the DRL solver alongside classical solvers. Compare resilience profiles in the scorecard.

### DRL Adaptive Scheduler
**Status:** Task schedulers are classical (random, closest, balanced, roundtrip). No learned scheduler exists.  
**Impact:** Medium — optimal task-to-agent assignment changes mid-operation as faults accumulate. A learned policy could adapt to current fleet health and zone congestion in ways classical schedulers cannot.  
**What's needed:** Contextual bandit or lightweight DRL policy that maps current state (alive agent count, per-zone congestion, fault rate, agent heat distribution) to task assignment decisions. Implements `TaskScheduler` trait — drop-in replacement.  
**Research angle:** Does adaptive scheduling improve resilience compared to any fixed scheduler under progressive Weibull wear?

### ML Fault Prediction (LSTM on Heat Time Series)
**Status:** Failure ticks are pre-sampled from Weibull at init — each agent's death is predetermined. No online prediction exists.  
**Impact:** Medium — proactive redeployment before failure avoids cascade effects. Enables a new fault scenario type: `PredictiveMaintenance`.  
**What's needed:** LSTM or small Transformer trained on `(operational_age, heat, task_leg)` time series per agent → failure probability in next N ticks. New scenario: agent retires gracefully when predicted risk exceeds threshold, before the physical fault fires. Compare reactive vs predictive handling in the scorecard.  
**Data source:** MAFIS already logs heat levels every tick — training data is free from existing simulations.

### Meta-RL Solver Selection
**Status:** Solver is fixed at simulation start. No runtime switching exists.  
**Impact:** Low-medium — the optimal solver changes mid-operation (low density → PIBT fine; high density + cascading faults → RHCR better). Adaptive switching could outperform any fixed solver.  
**What's needed:** Multi-armed bandit or contextual DRL that selects the active solver based on current state features (density, recent throughput delta, fault rate, alive count). No MAPF policy training needed — just a meta-policy over existing solvers. Requires `ActiveSolver` hot-swapping without resetting agent plans.  
**Prerequisite:** Heterogeneous fleet support (otherwise the state space is too simple to warrant learned switching).

## Non-Goals

These are intentionally out of scope for MAFIS:

- **One-shot solver support** (CBS, LaCAM, PBS one-shot, LNS2) — MAFIS measures fault resilience under sustained operation; one-shot solvers are not lifelong-capable.
- **Optimal path planning** — MAFIS is a fault observatory, not a solver benchmark. Suboptimality is acceptable if throughput and resilience are measurable.
- **Real robot integration** — simulation-only by design.
